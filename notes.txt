looked into USB charger problem. confirmed it was a charger thing being too smart. seems this is a thing. looking up Anker PowerIQ shows that the voltage on the data line defines whether or not a the battery keeps charging for some models.

also, experiments show the teensy continues to draw power indefinitely (or near enough).

maybe we just need pull up or pull down resistors

got a plan to experimentally figure this issue out for this particular ANKER charger:

solder together a quick USB breakout board[1] with all four lines exposed. wire up 2 voltage dividers with D+ and D- in the middles. 1k resistors on GND side and 10k (or whatever) potentiometers on the 5V side. turn dials until power is stable.

measure current of 5V line between this circuit and the trinket load. measure duration of power. success is longer than 30 seconds of power. confirmation is overnight.

record final voltage values at D+ and D-.

[1] no need to go full OSHPark on this

Brought up the power problem at lunch. The suggestion came up that the circuit may not be drawing enough power. Sure enough, attaching 22 more LEDs made the battery last a lot longer. Dareisay, indefinitely. Plan to keep a plow pulse as the default state.

Anyway, now can proceed with PCB build out. The final PCB(s) should draw much more power than in the 23 LED case.
